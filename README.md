This folder contains examples of upmatrices and uptori identified or constructed by the code in this repository. Each file contains a collection of objects for a particular combination of alphabet and subarray dimensions and is named accordingly. The general scheme for the name of the files is _object-alphabet-rows-columns.txt_. For example, _upmatrix-2-3-4.txt_ would contain a single upmatrix for the binary alphabet whose subarrays have three rows and four columns.

Withing the files, each individual obejct is formatted with a newline after each row and two newlines between objects.
